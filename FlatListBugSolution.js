The solution involves using the `keyExtractor` prop within the `FlatList` component.  This prop provides a unique key for each item in the dataset, enabling React Native to efficiently update only the necessary items.  Additionally, consider using techniques like windowing or virtualization to further optimize rendering performance.  For very large datasets, pagination might be more suitable. Here's an example implementation:

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={data}
  keyExtractor={(item, index) => index.toString()}
  renderItem={({ item }) => (
    // Render item with the item data
  )} 
/>
```
