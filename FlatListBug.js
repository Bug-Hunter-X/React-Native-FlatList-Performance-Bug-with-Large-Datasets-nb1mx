This bug occurs when using the `FlatList` component in React Native with a large dataset.  The issue is that the `renderItem` function is called repeatedly, even for items that are off-screen. This leads to performance issues and can cause the app to freeze or crash. The problem stems from the fact that the component is constantly re-rendering items that aren't actually visible to the user.
